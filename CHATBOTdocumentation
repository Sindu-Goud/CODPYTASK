Python Chatbot Documentation

1. Introduction:

The Python Chatbot is a simple conversational agent implemented in Python. It engages in dialogue with users by responding to their inputs with predefined messages. The chatbot follows a rule-based approach to generate responses based on user input.

2. Features:

Responds to user inputs with predefined messages.
Supports basic conversational interactions such as greetings, inquiries about well-being, and farewells.
Provides a default response for inputs that do not match any predefined patterns.
3. Responses:

The chatbot's responses are defined in a dictionary format, where keys represent patterns in user input, and values are lists of possible responses associated with each pattern. The chatbot selects a response based on the pattern found in the user input or defaults to a generic response if no match is found.

4. Functions:

a. generate_response(user_input):

Description: Generates a response based on user input.
Parameters:
user_input: String representing the user's input.

b. main():

Description: Main function to handle user interaction.

5. Usage:

6. Example:

vbnet

Chatbot: Hi! I'm a simple chatbot. You can start chatting with me. Type 'quit' to exit.
